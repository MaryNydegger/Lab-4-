# Lab 4 - Ensembles


### Directions
* *Accept the Assignment*: When you accept the assignment in GitHub Classroom, a repository named `lab-04` will be automatically generated for you under the "s486Fall2023" organization.
* *Locate Your Repository*: Your personal repository for this homework can be found at `https://github.com/s486Fall2023/lab-04-your_user_name`.
* *Clone the Repository*: 
    - Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to download the repository.
    - Run `git clone [your repository URL]` to clone the repository onto your local machine.
* *Working Directory*: The cloning process will create a new directory named `lab-04-your_user_name`. Ensure that you perform all your work inside this directory.
* *Commit Your Progress*: As you work on the assignment, remember to commit your changes periodically. You can easily do this using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
* *Remote Connection*: If you've cloned the repository correctly and are working within the created directory, the remote link to your GitHub repository should already be configured.
* *File and Function Names*:
    - Please complete your assignment in the file called `lab-04.ipynb` except for the random forest function, which you should put in a file called `random_forest.py`
    - Lab questions are contained in the file `lab-04.ipynb`
    - As you work out the problems and experiment with code, you can use another file (work.py or work.ipynb) if you want but you don't need to
    - For your final answers and code, use the file `lab04.ipynb` and `random_forest.py`
    - Do not include any superfluous code in your final .ipynb or .py files, but **DO** submit well-commented code.
    - Do not print or show anything in your final code, except for the requested items. 
    - Be sure that your function for Problem 2 is called `random_forest` and is in a separate file called `random_forest.py`

* You do not need to submit on Gradescope.  Just submit all your work to the GitHub repo.
